    <h1>Roasted garlic pasta</h1>
    <img src="/images/roastedgarlicpasta.png" alt="">
    <p>This roasted garlic pasta showcases the sweet, mellow, rich, and nutty flavors that develop when you roast garlic. It’s a date-night-worthy meal, especially if you add sea scallops on top—I usually do—but it is delicious as is, too. My favorite scallop recipe is in the note below.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>italian parsley</li>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
        <li>lemon juice</li>
        <li>garlic cloves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Add garlic to a small oven-safe dish; pour olive oil on top to submerge the garlic. Cover the dish with a lid or foil.</li>
        <li>Bake garlic in the preheated oven for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Add parsley, lemon zest, lemon juice, and red pepper flakes to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>At the 50-minute mark, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; add pasta and cook until tender with a bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain; set aside to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Remove roasted garlic from the oven, and carefully pour off the oil into the bowl with parsley mixture. Add in roasted garlic, leaving cloves intact, or crushing some or all of them. Stir in cheese. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Stir pasta into the bowl with sauce, coating each and every noodle. Divide between 2 bowls. Sprinkle with a little more cheese if desired, and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
